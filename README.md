# censorship-event-detection

This repository contains the framework and data presented in I Can Show You the World (of Censorship): Extracting Insights from Censorship Measurement Data Using Statistical Techniques. Our framework consists of two statistical techniques, the Mann-Kendall trend detection test (MK) and control charts and it identifies periods of change within censorship measurement data corresponding to potential censorship events. 

# Repository contents:
- An implementation of our framework as a Jupyter notebook ([framework.ipynb](/framework)). The notebook can be edited to run on any censorship measurement or network measurement dataset. 
- An implementation of our framework applied to all of the datasets used in our paper ([framework.py](/framework)). The framework outputs the results in ([results](/results)). For further information see the README in `/results`.
- The data used in our paper ([data](/data))
  - We implemented our framework on data from Censored Planet's Satellite, Hyperquack HTTP, and HTTPS as well as OONI, GFWatch, and Tor. We used data from six countries - Russia, Myanmmar, China, Iran, TÃ¼rkiye, and Pakistan - from January 2021 through March 2023.
  - For details of the processed data available in this repository see the README `/data`.
  - The raw data for our work can be downloaded from ([Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org)), ([OONI](https://ooni.org)), ([GFWatch](https://gfwatch.org)), and ([Tor](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html)). 

# Requirement
Python3.9

# Setup
After cloning the repository setup a python virtual environment within the project directory:
```
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```
Install required python libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt -I
```
# Running the framework
- `framework.ipynb` can be executed as is within a Jupyter notebook environment (launch environment by running `jupyter notebook`). It will run on OONI China data. To run the notebook on a new dataset edit the variables `path_to_dataset`, `typ`, `version`, and `index` to fit the new dataset.

- To execute `framework.py`:
```
cd framework
python3 framework.py
```
- The results will be output to csv files and stored in `/results`.
